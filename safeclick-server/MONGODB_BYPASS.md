# MongoDB Bypass Instructions

## Changes Made

### 1. Server.js
- Commented out `mongoose` import
- Commented out MongoDB connection code  
- Added direct server start without waiting for MongoDB
- Added console logs indicating MongoDB bypass

### 2. scrapeController.js
- Commented out `ScrapeResult` model import
- Commented out database save operation
- Added console logging for scraped data
- Application now returns data directly without storing

### 3. Package.json Considerations
The `mongoose` dependency is still listed in package.json but is not used in the code.

**Option 1 (Recommended):** Keep mongoose in package.json for future use
**Option 2:** Remove it completely by running: `npm uninstall mongoose`

## Running the Server

The server will now start without requiring MongoDB:

```bash
cd hacksky-server
npm install  # installs all dependencies (including unused mongoose)
node server.js
```

Expected output:
```
Starting server without MongoDB dependency...
Server is running at port 5000
MongoDB dependency bypassed - running in stateless mode
```

## What Works Now

✅ **Web scraping** - Puppeteer extracts content without saving to DB
✅ **AI detection** - Gemini API calls work independently  
✅ **Fact checking** - Gemini + Google Search work independently
✅ **Chrome extension** - All API calls function normally

## What's Different

❌ **No data persistence** - Scraped content is not saved
❌ **No history** - Previous scans are not stored
❌ **Stateless operation** - Server doesn't remember past requests

## Benefits

✅ **Faster startup** - No database connection delays
✅ **Simpler deployment** - No MongoDB setup required
✅ **Lower resource usage** - No database overhead
✅ **Development friendly** - Works immediately without DB setup

## Future Considerations

If you want to re-enable MongoDB later:
1. Uncomment the lines in `server.js`
2. Uncomment the lines in `scrapeController.js`  
3. Set up `MONGO_URI` environment variable
4. Restart the server

The model files (`models/ScrapeResult.js`) are preserved for future use.
