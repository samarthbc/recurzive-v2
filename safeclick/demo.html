            <h2>üö® Fake News Section</h2>
            <p>BREAKING: Scientists discover that drinking <span class="highlight">hot water with lemon</span> can cure cancer in just 3 days! This revolutionary treatment has been kept secret by big pharmaceutical companies for years. Share this immediately before they take it down!</p>
            <p>According to "Dr. Smith" (who we can't verify), this simple home remedy has been used by ancient civilizations and works 100% of the time. The government doesn't want you to know about this because they profit from expensive treatments.</p>
